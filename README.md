# AMT Project (Development of a Multi-Tiered App)
![](multiTieredApp.PNG)

Date: 10/20/2016

Version 1.0

##Introduction
In this repository we have a web application that runs on a wildfly server in which the application is autodeployed.  
The application is launch via a docker container.
The principal objectif ot the  project is to apply the technologies, techniques and design patterns (MVC, DAO) presented during the Multi-Tiered Application course. We used Java EE application server, netbeans to develop the web application, and JAX-RS API in order to have a Restfull application.

##Goal
1. *Design and implement a page with a login and registration form*

2. *Implement a security filter to protect pages from unauthenticated users in other words   create a uesr space*

3. *Allow registered users to login and access protected pages(user space) and not access them anymore once they're not logged in*
4. *implement a REST API with JAX-RS*
5. *Use the DAO design pattern and JDBC to interact with the relational mysql database*

##Requirement  
1 - Install docker and docker-compose if not yet done. Click [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) to install.  
2 - Clone this repo to a folder of your choice.
````
git clone git@github.com:pascalsekley/Projet-AMT.git (if you have an ssh configuration on github)  
git clone https://github.com/pascalsekley/Projet-AMT.git (for https cloning)
````
3 - You can use [docker machine windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) for windows is you're on windows platform. And [docker machine mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) if you're on mac OS platform.

##How to Run   
Assuming that you have cloned this repo and that you have installed docker on your machine.
Once you're in the root you have to build the app. Let's compile the war first using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) command:

1 - `mvn compile war:war`. 

Copy the newly generated ".war" file  to the folder containing the wildfly dockerfile.

2 - `cp target/project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war images/wildfly/`

Navigate to the folder named topology-amt of the cloned directory and fire up docker-compose to start the server :
  
`docker-compose up --build`  
Notice that once the server is started the application is automatically deployed on the wildfly server. Two other containers are launched when the above command is executed. One which run phpmyadmin and the other runs mysql.
**URL to Access** are :
````
http://192.168.99.100:9090 (wildfly server  welcome page)    
http://192.168.99.100:9090/project-1.0-SNAPSHOT (application)  
http://192.168.99.100:9990(console -> admin/admin)
http://192.168.99.100:6060(phpmyadmin console -> root/adminpw)    
````  

To access the management wildfly console use this link: `http://192.168.99.100:9990/console/App.html`

the username is admin and the password is admin

To access the phpmyadmin console use this link: `http://192.168.99.100:6060/`

the `username is root` and the `password is adminpw`

##The database
![](dataBaseTable.PNG)
> We decided to use as unique ID the username of a user which is supposed to uniquely identify a user in our database. The username is the primary key in that case.

##REST API
On using the REST ressources of our application, the entry point to our application is **_/api_**. Our implementation of REST makes it possible for a user to achieve the CRUD operations. As shown below we have a list of possible operations that can be achieved with our API.  


**Insert a user (Create)**
